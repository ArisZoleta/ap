# AP
AP Theme is an abbreviation of "About Portfolio".  
AP Theme is taking the blog form as a website for career management.  


## Structure
"About" is a simple personal history.  
"Portfolio" is your project experience.  
Portfolio is written in blog form and you can accumulate your history.  


## About
This Theme is the theme I created for career management.  
In the future, I plan to update the parts that I feel personally need.  
If you have any special needs, please request them freely.
